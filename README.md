# Hirst Painting Project

Another fun project from my Udemy Python course!  
I had such a great time working with the Turtle graphics library and exploring new modules like `colorgram`.  
I learned how to extract real colors from an image (inspired by Damien Hirst’s artwork) and used them to create my own digital painting using Python.  

I’m excited to keep learning and experimenting with more creative coding projects!
